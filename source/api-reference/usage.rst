Usage
=====

The Usage API provides an an interface-agnostic way for QIIME 2 plugin
developers to define examples of how to use their plugin actions . This
enables the programmatic generation of examples for all QIIME 2 interfaces,
thus eliminating the need to hand-write different examples for different
interfaces, lessening the burden of maintaining up-to-date documentation.
